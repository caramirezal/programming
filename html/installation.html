<h2> 4. Loading network models </h2>

<h3> 4.1. SQUAD format </h3>

<p> To define a Regulatory Network model using squad formalism it is necessary to define a set of variables nodes 
and also include regulatory dependencies between them. In squad formalism regulatory dependencies 
are incorporated to the ordinary differential equations in the form of <i>omega</i> input parameters. 
The <i>omega</i> input functions are similar to Boolean expressions of the BRN model and can be obtained from them 
straightforwardly by changing <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b>, and <b>NOT</b> Boolean operators by the fuzzy logic operators 
<i>min</i>(), <i>max</i>() and <i>1−x</i> (where <i>x</i> is the value of the input). </p>

<p> Nodes names and their regulatory dependencies can be given by using the squad format. This format is very similar 
to BoolNet format, see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BoolNet/index.html">BoolNet</a>
 R Package for further references. The next lines show the content of a
squad format saved in a standard .txt file called "cartoonNetwork.txt". </p>

<code>

targets, factors <br>
A, A <br>
B, min(A,1-C) <br>
C, 1 - max(A,B) <br>

</code>

<p> The squad format consist of a text file that includes in its first line the headers “targets, factors”. 
The following lines contain the names of the variables and fuzzy logic equations of the <i>omega</i> input 
function separated by a comma. So for example, the associated parameter <omega> for node B is defined as
<i> w = min</i>(<i>A,1-C</i>). This format can be imported to squad R package by using loadNetwork.sq() as
shown in the following example.</p>

<code> 
<br>
> ## loading network  <br>
> net.sq <- loadNetwork.sq("cartoonNetwork.txt") <br>
 <br>
> ## Initial state definition <br>
> initialState <- c("A"=0,"B"=1,"C"=0)  <br>
 <br>
> ## running simulation <br>
> squad(net.sq, initialState=initialState, plot= "timeSerie") <br>
<br>

</code>

<p> The output is shown in the next figure which shows a single trajectory starting  
from an initial state <code>= c(0,0,1)</code>. </p>

<img src="figures/squadFormat.png" style="width:750px;height:600px;padding-left:100px;">

<p> <br>
This example also introduces the squad() function. This function allows performing continuous simulations 
and will be discussed in more detail in section <a href="simulations.html">5 Running simulations</a>.
The parameter initialState is used to define the initial values of the nodes in the network and plot 
parameter set to "timeSerie" tells squad() to return a time serie plot of the simulated trajectory.  </p>

<br>

<h3> 4.2. Starting from discrete models</h3>

<p> 
As mentioned aboved, BRN are parameters free simple models focused in simulating the dynamic of the
network driven by positive or negative (or dual) interactions.
In practice, it is usually convenient to start with such a simple approach and then transit 
to more complex formalisms if needed. The SQUAD R package can be used in combination with BoolNet to automate 
this task as follows.
</p>

<p>We will use here a BRN model available in the BoolNet R package. The model contains key regulators of the 
mammalian cell cycle.</p>

<code> 
> data("cellcycle")  <br>
> cellcycle
</code>

<br>
<br>

<div class="output">
	<code>
Boolean network with 10 genes <br>
<br>
Involved genes: <br>
CycD Rb E2F CycE CycA p27 Cdc20 Cdh1 UbcH10 CycB <br>
<br>
Transition functions: <br
CycD = CycD <br>
Rb = (! CycA & ! CycB & ! CycD & ! CycE) | (p27 & ! CycB & ! CycD) <br>
E2F = (! Rb & ! CycA & ! CycB) | (p27 & ! Rb & ! CycB) <br>
CycE = (E2F & ! Rb) <br>
CycA = (E2F & ! Rb & ! Cdc20 & ! (Cdh1 & UbcH10)) | (CycA & ! Rb & ! Cdc20 & ! (Cdh1 & UbcH10)) <br>
p27 = (! CycD & ! CycE & ! CycA & ! CycB) | (p27 & ! (CycE & CycA) & ! CycB &! CycD) <br>
Cdc20 = CycB <br>
Cdh1 = (! CycA & ! CycB) | (Cdc20) | (p27 & ! CycB) <br>
UbcH10 = ! Cdh1 | (Cdh1 & UbcH10 & (Cdc20 | CycA | CycB)) <br>
CycB = ! Cdc20 & ! Cdh1 <br>

	</code>
</div>

<p>
The cellcycle object belongs to BooleanNetwork class as that defined by the BoolNet R package. Using 
asContinuous() this object can be automatically transformed to a continuous interpolation. In the next 
code, cellcyle BooleanNetwork object is transformed to cellcycle.sq squad object.
</p>

<code>
> ## cellcycle "BooleanNetwork" interpolated to cellcycle.sq <br>
> ## continuous model <br>
> cellcycle.sq <- asContinuous(cellcycle) <br>
> <br>
> ## initial State definition <br>
> initialState <- rep(0,length(cellcycle$genes)) <br>
> ## running simulation <br>
> <br>
> squad(cellcycle, <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialState = initialState, <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot = "timeSerie", <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timePeriod = 20) <br>

</code>

<p> </p>

<br>

<p> In this example, we started the simulation with all genes equal to <code>0/OFF</code>. The 
parameter timePeriod was used to set virtual time duration in the simulation. From the image, it 
can be seen that the network trajectory became stationary at values <code>= 0.5</code> for all nodes except for cycD 
which has a value equal to <code>0</code>.
</p>

<!--------------------STARTING FROM CONNECTIVITY MATRICES----------------------------------------->

<h3> 4.3. Starting from connectivity matrices</h2>

<p> For the vast majority of regulatory interactions only information regarding direction and type 
(positive, negative, or dual) is available. This qualitative information can
be represented by graphs or adjacency matrices. An adjacency matrix <b>M</b> 
representing a network can be defined as square matrix that contains nodes names in both columns 
and rows. Every entry <b>m</b><sub>i,j</sub> takes the values 1, -1, or 0 if there is a positive, negative or
no interaction from node <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>, respectively. So defined static representation
of a regulatory network is frequently referred as the network <i>topology</i>.
</p>

<p> It is very useful to automate the definition of a dynamic BRN model by means of its 
network topology. SQUAD R package incorporates the graphToModel() function to automate this task.
In the following example, a random connectivity matrix is defined using the randomMatrix() function.
The output of randomMatrix() is a square matrix R object. The parameter matrixDimension is set up 
to 10 and defines the number of nodes. 
The adjacency matrix is then transformed to a BRN model using graphToModel() function.

 </p>

<code>
> ## getting a random connectivity matrix of 10 nodes <br>
> adjMatrix <- randomMatrix(matrixDimension=10) <br>
> <br>
> ## connectivity matrix to BRN model  <br>
> net.b <- graphToModel(adjMatrix) <br>
> <br>
> ## plotting the graph <br>
> plotNetworkWiring(net.b) <br>
</code>

<p> </p>

<img src="figures/randomMatrix.png"  style="padding-left:200px;width:600px;height:600px;">

<p> The figure shows the network topology as defined by the connectivity matrix defined
using randomMatrix(). In real cases, adjacency matrices
for biological regulatory networks can be obtained from available data bases or by using
inference methods from high-throughput expression data. <p>

<p>Then, asContinuous() function can be applied to <code>net.b</code> 
BooleanNetwork object to obtain a squad interpolation as shown in the next code lines.
</p>

<br>
<code>
> ## BRN to squad <br>
> net.sq <- asContinuous(net.b)  <br>
> <br>
> ## running simulation <br>
> squad(net.sq, initialState = rep(0,length(net.sq$genes)),plot = "timeSerie") <br>
</code>

<br>

<img src="figures/startingFromMatrix.png" style="padding-left:200px;width:600px;height:600px;">

<br>

<p> It is noteworthy to say that the modeller can end up with a BRN discrete model or transit to a continuous interpolation depending on the modeling requirements.</p>

<h3> 5. Running simulations</h3>

<p> Once we have a continuous Regulatory Network (RN) squad object, simulations can be carried out. The
squad() function was designed to be a platform for setting simulation parameters, performing simulations,
and optionally plotting results. 

In this section, squad() function is described. </p>
